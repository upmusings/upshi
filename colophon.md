# Colophon

This site is set in [Valkyrie](https://mbtype.com/fonts/valkyrie/), built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). You can check out the source [here](https://github.com/upmusings/upshift).

Valkyrie is a humanist typeface made by [Matthew Butterick](https://mbtype.com/bio.html) that has a beautiful calligraphic feel. In order to really appreciate it and improve this site's typography, I've enabled ligatures and kerning + typographic features being controlled via CSS as well, you can view the source and poke around.

For content management, I use Jekyll's static site generator cause [it works seamlessly with GitHub Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/). Changes are tracked by Git and every time I push, thus no headache of having to deploy the built files to a separate repo or branch.

Blog also supports title-less posts by design, making it easy + efficient to get thoughts out without stewing over an appropriate title. This also works really well for integrating with Micro.blog. 

## This is a curated list of some of the best or most important tools/resources I’ve come across.
